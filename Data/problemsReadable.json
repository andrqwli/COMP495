We have also been using functions that come with JavaScript (Math.sqrt, Math.floor, etc.) since nearly the beginning.  We will now learn more about how to write and use function like Math.sqrt() where we pass in some information and get a result back.  \nWe wrote one back in module on simple functions (it cubed its parameter and returned it).  Now we will practice more.\nWe will call the functions we write here simple utility functions.  They will be handy for asking (and answering) small but useful questions like \"is this number an integer\" or \"is this number odd\" in our programs as we progress.\nWe write a simple utility function in a way very similar to how we are writing myMain.  However, since we are passing information\nin (like we do when we call Math.sqrt(4) for example) for the function to use while computing a result, we will have to specify a\nparameter.  Also, since the point of a utility function is to get some result back, we will need to add a return \nstatement to the body of the function when we define it.\nTo complete this problem, type in and execute this code:\n\"use strict\";\n\nfunction myMain ( ) {\n   var x = 5;\n   var dubx = double(x);\n   alert(dubx);\n}\n\nfunction double ( num ) {\n   var val = num*2;\n   return val;\n}\n\nmyMain();\nNote that to do these programs with our own functions, we will need to write the myMain( ) function as we have been, and we will also write\nanother function (or several more).  These extra functions will be called by the code in the body of myMain.\n"

It means that if you do not break out, then the loop will never stop repeating.\nYou will experience this as your browser wedging... locking up... as the JavaScript engine runs endlessly and consumes all the browser horsepower.\nHow can you fail to break out?  You might get the condition logic wrong and write a boolean expression that will not evaluate to true and so will not trigger the \"break\".\nYou might forget to update the user input, so the loop keeps testing the first input and never gets more.\nThere are several ways to mess it up.

So we will use a while loop that squares, checks for \"near zero\", and repeats if needed.\nWrite a program to do the following things.\nFirst ask the user to input a number between 0 and 1. It will be very important in this program to validate that\nthe user has given us what we asked for because if the number is 1 or larger, your program will loop infinitely and you will be very irritated.\nSo validate two things: if the input is not a number, or if the number is not in the range 0 to 1 (smaller than 1), print \"error, try again\"\nand re-ask the user for correct input.\nOnce you get a good number, use a while loop to do the repeated squaring we need to do.\nIn the while loop body, square the number by multiplying it by itself and storing it back into the variable (like the accumulator pattern). \nWrite the loop to stop this repeated squaring when the variable value is smaller than the tolerance ( 0.0001 ).\nCount how many times we had to square the user number to get smaller than the tolerance. Print out this count after the loop ends.\nTo do this, we will be counting loop body executions, with attention to special cases.  For example, if the user gives an initial number\nthat is already smaller than 0.0001, then we want to report 0 as the output, since there is no need to square it at all.\nIf the user gives 0.01 as input, then the square is 0.0001 (not smaller than 0.0001) after 1 squaring, and we would square it a second time\nto get under the tolerance; output would be 2.\nStyle: Use two while loops -- one for validating user input, and a second while loop for repeated squaring.

The components of an object are called its \"fields\" or \"properties\".\nLater we will see that objects can contain functions as well as data, but for now we will think of them as a wrapper around a\ncollection of named data items.  Although the data items in an object are called \"fields\" or \"properties\" we can also think of them\nas variables.  They will behave like variables... we will be able to store data into them, and retrieve data from them, and use them in\nexpressions.\nWe will start with object literals.  An object literal is a way of specifying an object value directly, like a constant... like 5 is a number literal or\n\"go heels\" is a string literal.\nTo complete this problem type in and run this code:\n\"use strict\";\n\nfunction myMain() {\n   alert( {a:5, b:\"hello\"}.a );\n   alert( {a:5, b:\"hello\"}.b );\n}\n\nmyMain();\nHere, the object literal (value) is  {a:5, b:\"hello\"} which contains two fields, tagged \"a\" and \"b\".  The \"dot notation\" is used to select a field.\nThus,  {a:5, b:\"hello\"}.a says to select the value of the field tagged \"a\" from the object, and the alert will print 5.\nNow type in the following code:\n\"use strict\";\n\nfunction myMain() {\n  var obj = {a:5, b:\"hello\"};\n  alert( obj.a );\n  alert( obj.b );\n}\n\nmyMain();\nIf you run this (or submit it for score) you will see that it does the same thing as the first form.  In this second form, we create a variable and store the object\nliteral into it (same as doing \"var x = 5;\" with a number literal).  We now see that the dot notation, to select a field from an object, can be used after a variable name also.\nThis second form is by far the more heavily used way to create and access objects.\nEven though we saw that objects do have literal values (like the {a:5, b:\"hello\"} ) there is a difference between a literal object and a literal number data value.  A number literal does not\nhave parts, or components; it is unstructured ... it has only one part.  In contrast, objects have parts -- they are constructed from components (the fields) and they are organized.\nThey are what we call structured data.  We will see that you can used an object as an abstract collection (by referring to the variable containing the object) or you can\nuse a piece of an object... you can access portions of the structure.

So if we want 100 as possible output, we must scale to (almost) 101 and let Math.floor truncate to 100.\nFor the second output, we note that we need to shift the range up 5 from 0. The high end of the range we want is 25, so if we generate a number between 0 and 20, then add 5 we get a range of 5 to 25. So we can scale the range by multiplying the output of Math.random, and we can shift the range by adding to the result of Math.random (or the result of Math.floor(scaled random).\n"

The numbers begin with 0, and go upwards by 1.  An array has a name, like a simple\nvariable, and is declared like a variable.  But unlike a simple variable, to store or retrieve a data value we must specify the slot number (called the \"index\").\nWith an array, we must keep separate the difference between the slot number and the data value stored in that slot.  Slot numbers are always integer (type number);\nthe data stored in the array slot itself can be any type (including an object, or even another array as we will see).\nHere is an array of cars over at the Carolina Inn.  In slot 2 is a silver Volvo.  In slot 3 is a white Cadillac.  It's not difficult with physical cars to see the difference \nbetween the integer 2 (slot number) and a Volvo (\"data\" stored in the slot). There will be a bit more confusion when we want to store number data in array slots that\nare numbered. .\nWe can also think of an array as a row of mail boxes.  Each box has a number (address), and contents (the mail). We will have syntax in JavaScript to\nspecify the address, and different syntax to open the box at an address and put in (take out) the mail.  To open and use a mailbox (array slot) we\nput square brackets after the array variable name (like \" arr[ ... ] \" ).  To specify an address (slot number) we put an expression that evaluates to an integer\ninside the square brackets (like \" arr[ 5 ] \" or \" arr[ x+3 ] \" ).\nType in and execute this code (it is global code, that's ok here):\n\"use strict\";\n\nfunction myMain() {\n   var data = [ 7, \"smith\", -4.25, true ];\n   alert(data.length);  \n   alert(data[0]);\n   alert(data[1]);\n   alert(data[2]);\n   alert(data[3]);\n   alert(data[10-7]);\n   alert( data[10 - data[0] ] ) ;\n   alert(data[0] * data[2]);\n   alert(data[Math.sqrt(4)]);\n   var x = 2;\n   alert(data[x]);\n   var arr = data;  // copies the entire array as a whole\n   alert(arr[0]);\n}\n\nmyMain();\nTo know how many items are in an array, use the \"length\" property.  For the variable \"data\" above the \nexpression \"data.length\" tells how many items are stored in that array (in this case, 4 elements).\nTo access an array element we use an expression inside \"[\" \"]\" square brackets.\nThe expression must evaluate to a non-negative integer.\nIn this example we use mostly integer literals; in future programs we will use variable names, as well\nas more complex expressions like 2*x +1, etc.\nAlso, arrays subscripts (slots numbers) always begin with 0.  \nThis creates a bit of confusion until you are used to it, since\nthe first element in the array is at slot 0.  An array with 2 items in it will use subscripts 0 and 1.  Just\npay attention when you write code and think carefully about the expressions you use for subscripts.\nIn the example above, we see that arr has 4 elements and uses slot numbers 0 through 3.\n"

We do create an argument list (in parentheses) and the code body (in curly braces).\nIt is identical to defining a named function except we do not give it a name.\nHere is an example (using the code from the previously defined named function \"double\"):\nfunction ( n ) {  return 2*n; }\nAgain, this is a function value... it is the same thing for type \"function\" as writing the number value \"5\" is for type \"number\".\nIt is valid JavaScript, and we must now decide what we wish to do with this value.  In this program we will take that\nfunction value, and bind it to a global name using assignment.  In the next program, we will see how to execute that\nfunction value without ever naming it.\nDetails. First at the global level create an anonymous function value using the previous code for \"double\" with one argument (as shown\nin the previous pre-format box).  Assign that anonymous function to the global variable \"double\" using assignment.\nThen define the global function (myMain) as we usually do.

This program illustrates that the \"normal\" way of defining functions -- using the \"function\" keyword and a name for the function --\nis actually a shorthand notation for doing what we are doing here... creating a nameless function value, and then binding it to a global name.\nBinding it to a global name is what makes us able to run the function from within our other functions.\nAlso, we must be careful to get our code in the right order.  Since we are explicitly creating a global variable (the name for the function) we\nmust do that declaration and binding before we call myMain.  If we do not, when myMain runs and tried to call the function bound to \nthe name \"double\", that global variable will not yet have been declared.

Usually we have some common functions as well: deal cards (to the table, to hands), shuffle the deck, pass card from one player to\nanother, lay card on the table.\nWe will start simple: let's create a card representation, a deck representation, and a way to shuffle\nthe deck.  \nFor starters (we will complicate things later) let's represent a deck of cards as an array with \nas many slots as there are cards in the deck.  Let's also represent a card as an integer between 0 and\nthe size of the deck.\nFor order of the deck, we will use the order of elements in the array.\nFor example, let's consider a deck with 5 cards in it.   Initially we can generate an array with 5 elements\nand we will put one of the integers from 0 to 4 in each slot:\n         +----+----+----+----+----+\narray:   | 0  | 1  | 2  | 3  | 4  |  \n         +----+----+----+----+----+\nslot:      0    1    2    3    4\nAfter shuffling, the deck array might look like this:\n         +----+----+----+----+----+\narray:   | 3  | 0  | 4  | 2  | 1  |  \n         +----+----+----+----+----+\nslot:      0    1    2    3    4\nCode:In myMain, first ask the user how many cards to put into the deck.\nThen create an array to represent the deck, and load up the array with the proper integers in\norder.  Print the deck array to verify that all is well (use an alert on the array variable and the whole\nthing will appear in one alert box).\nNow write a function called shuffle that takes one parameter, a deck array.\nShuffle will move the array values around randomly so that the cards get put into a new, random order.\nReturn the array that has been shuffled.\nBack in myMain, call the shuffle function and pass in the card deck.\nWhen shuffle returns a re-ordered deck array, save that into the deck variable.\nThen print the entire deck again to verify the shuffled order.\n How to shuffleWe will use in the shuffle function the Math.random function.  \nThe values stored in the array (the \"cards\") will remain as they are.  The location (slot) of each\n\"card\" will change randomly.\nThe basic idea is to randomly generate 2 slot numbers and then swap the cards stored in those slots.\nDo this swap a few thousand times and the deck will be nicely rearranged.\nLet's use for an example a deck with 52 cards.  You will need an expression that will generate a\nrandom integer between   0 and 51.  Call this twice to get two slots between 0 and 51, then swap\nthose two array elements.  We did a swap back in the bubbleUp brick.  Use this as a pattern.\nTo get scoredRemove the alerts that print the entire deck array (those were for your personal debugging).\nMake a deck with 20 cards, and then do the following outputs.\nBefore shuffling: alert the first element of the new deck, then the 7th element, and the finally\nthe 13th element ( 3 separate alerts).  After shuffling: alert the first element, then the 7th element, and finally\nthe 13th element ( 3 separate alerts).\nMake sure you also do exactly 10 swaps in the shuffle function."

The value true is boolean, but the value \"true\" is a string. In similar fashion,\nthe value 200 is a number, but the value \"200\" is a string.\nWe will look at boolean in detail later.  In this module, we will practice mostly with numbers and strings.\nOutputIn order for a computer program to be useful to us, it not only has to manipulate information, if must get that information out to us in a form we can understand and use.  This is called output.  Programming languages usually offer many ways to get a computer to output information. For JavaScript we will start with the very basic \"print something to the screen\" function.  This is the alert function.\nThe alert function in JavaScript produces a popup box on the screen, with the requested output printed inside the box.\nUsing the alert function it is our first example of a function call.   \nWhen we call a function we are asking that the program perform the named activity, and we pass information to the function to use \nduring its activity.  To call a function (in this case, the \"alert\" function) we write its name and in parentheses we write the information we wish to pass in (called parameters, or arguments). \nSo let's try calling the alert function to get some output.\nTo complete this problem, type the following JavaScript line, run it, and then submit it for credit:\n&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp alert( \"data types: number, string, boolean\" ) ;Make sure you pay careful attention to where all the blank characters are inside the quotes, and how many there are.  To get this program correct, your quoted string will have to be exactly the same as the one shown there.  This sort of detail is very important in programming and it can be very frustrating to you -- the programmer -- as well.  \nNote that the syntax we use to call a function is based on mathematical notation.  We have all seen something like this:\n &nbsp&nbsp&nbsp  y = sine(x)Here the function we are \"running\" is the trigonometric sine and the information we are passing in is the argument x.\nThe function computes a value based on x and produces it.  \nThe programs that follow will show you examples of the 3 fundamental data types in JavaScript: number, string, and boolean.\nAll data values in our JavaScript programs will be of these types.  The programs in this module will show you how data values of each type are formed.\nWe call these individual data values \"constants\".  A constant is a data value that does not change (i.e., its value is fixed... constant).\n"

To do this we first must get the information that we do have into the program, stored into variables so the rest of the program can manipulate that data.  We call this input, or \nuser input.\nIn the previous problems, the numbers and data we wanted to compute with were typed directly into the program source code. However, for most programs, most of the data cannot be known when the program is written.  It will come from the user when the program is run.  We call the time that a program is executed run-time.\nThere are several ways to get input at run-time from a user in JavaScript; we start with the prompt statement.  A prompt statement will pop up a box on the screen with a message printed to the user, and wait for the user to type something in response (with a return key).  Whatever the user types is sent back as string data and can be used in any way a string can be used.\nType this program and run it :\n    alert ( prompt(\"What is your name?\") );The user sees the message \"What is your name?\" and whatever the user types in response will become the string the alert statement will print.\nThe prompt statement produces a string (the one the user types) and then that string is used by the alert as parameter.\nIf (for example) the user types \"Bob\" then the effect of this code is to do an  alert(\"Bob\");Let's examine a more common way to do this sort of input.  Since the prompt statement produces a string (from the keyboard) we usually\nissue the prompt statement as a stand-alone statement and \"capture\" the string it produces, saving that string into a variable.\nWe can then use the variable in the same ways we have been doing in the earlier programs:\n var uName = prompt(\"What is your name?\"); alert(uName);Try this alternate way as well to see how it works."

This will keep you from having to work out the complicated quadratic equation expressions again.\nWe will use three separate prompt statements to get the values for a, b, and c from the user.  First prompt the user for the value for a;  then prompt for a value for b; then get c.

Since you know (from previous programs) what the output should be, use those value here to test your program. \nWhen you run it locally and the prompt statement boxes show on the screen, type in those values (one per prompt).\nThen try some other values and check manually to see if the results you get match what the equation should compute.\n"

So we will get most of what we want using Math.floor.  \nThe floor function works as truncation as long as we use it only on positive numbers.\nOnly on negative numbers does Math.floor give results that are different from truncation.  Try a few for yourself to see how it works.\nMath.trunc is supposed to do this:  On N > 0, same as Math.floor; on NNote: Once we have learned about conditional statements, we can write our own bulletproof \"trunc\" by doing just what that last sentence says... \ncheck the number we are working on to see if it negative, and call Math.ceil() on it... and otherwise call Math.trunc() on it.\nThis is what conditionals are for -- choosing one thing or another, depending on data values when we are executing.

Then print the first number raised to the power of the second.\nUse separate alerts for the outputs.\nAs with previous problems in this folder, make sure to use proper myMain format.\n"

We need to write our programs to deal gracefully with such errors.\nAt the very minimum we can detect input errors, notify the user, and end execution.  \nWe might also ask the user to do the input again, correctly and keep asking until the errors end.\nAs we get more sophisticated we could even try to adapt the input values, correct them and use them in a new form.  \nThere are many ways a user can give erroneous input, but for now we will deal with 3 major types:\ntype error: the user is asked to input a number but give something like \"go heels\", which is not a number\nformat error: the use is asked for an integer, but gives something like 24.713 which is not an integer\nrange error: the user is asked for a positive integer less than 50, but types in something like -5 or 101.\nWe will see how to check for each of these in the programs in this section. For now to complete this overview\ntype this code in as the body of function myMain and run it locally (don't submit yet for scoring):\n  var x =5;\n  alert(x);\n  // return;\n  var y=7;\n  alert(y);\nNote that the \"return\" statement is commented out initially.

Now the return statement will execute.  Run the code again.  \nNow what you will see is that the code before the \"return\" executes, and the code after does not.  So the output now is the single output \"5\" and then \nmyMain stops executing at the return.  We can use the \"return\" statement at any point in\na function to make the function cease executing and go back to the part of the program where it was called.\nSubmit the altered code, with the return, for scoring."

For each way, print the sum. \nWe saw a task earlier (in the overview) that could be done with a loop or with recursion, both giving the same functional results.  \nIt turns out that any computation that can be done with recursion can be done with looping (and no recursion). Recursion is the functional way to do looping.\nThis is largely a theoretical consideration, as there are still many times when looping is better to use (more efficient in time and memory use).\nIn this program we show another example of doing one computation both recursively and non-recursively.\nWe also illustrate here the use of recursion in manipulating data structures (an array).  \nWe will write a program that processes an array of numbers two ways.\nFirst in myMain we will declare an array variable and initialize it with these 8 integers:\n  var nums = [10,20,30,40,50,60,70,80];\nNext we will write an iterative function that will receive an array as a parameter.

We will pass in an array, and return the sum of the elements in that array.\nThe base case happens when the array that is passed in has no elements.  We detect this case by looking at the length of the parameter array,\nand if that length is 0 we return 0 as the sum (no recursing needed).\nIf the array has a length or 1 or larger, then the strategy for recursion is to \"separate\" the array into two pieces: the first element, and the array that\nis left when we take the parameter array and take off the first element.  We can call our function recursively on this shortened array, and it will\nreturn the sum of the elements in the parameter array slots 1 on up.  We then add the first element to that and get the sum of the entire array.\nFinally write a myMain function that will first call the iterative function on the array, and then call the recursive function on the array.\nPrint \"looping\" and then with a second alert, print the sum returned by the iterative function. \nThen print \"recursion\" and with another alert, print the sum given by the recursive function.\nComputer science note.We have said one very important aspect of a recursive function is to make sure that the recursive case is given a smaller problem to work on (and that\nthe smaller problem is shrinking down to a base case).  In previous examples, the smaller problem meant passing a smaller number as parameter.\nHere we are passing a smaller array... an array that is shorter by one element.

The mod operator can be thought of as the\"remainder\" operator.  If we do division on numbers in JavaScript we get floating point (or real) arithmetic. With this division, we would expect the expression \n  26 / 3 \nto produce the floating point number 8.66666666, or 8 2/3 .  In integer division (not something JavaScript does) we would say the result is 8, with 2 left over.  So what we want for remainder in this problem is the 2 in the numerator of the 2/3 remainder.  \"Two left over\".\nIn modular arithmetic (using the mod operator) the evaluation uses integer division and the results are expressed as an integer and a remainder.  Thus we solve this problem this way:\n   26 % 3\nThe mod operator ( % ) is defined this way: a % b is the remainder when a is divided by b, using integer division. \nHere, the integer 3 goes into 26 completely 8 times, with 2 left over.  Therefore, the expression produces the remainder 2. Once\nyou have programmed the proper code for this problem, try other values to make sure you see how the % operator works.\nFor example, try these:\n  5 % 12   // expect 5\n 10 % 5    // expect 0\n  5 % 5    // expect 0\n 10 % 0    // expect error, divide by 0, Javascript gives Nan for \"Not a Number\"\n 18 % 12   // clock face is mod 12... 18 oclock is really 6 oclock PM\nTry some negative numbers as well.\nOne commonly understood example of modular arithmetic is the common clock face.\nAs the hands go around over and over, we do not get 13 o'clock, then 25 o'clock, then 37 o'clock, etc as time goes by.\nRather the \"time\" resets at 12 every revolution.

Some date back to the late 50's and early 60's (like FORTRAN, COBOL and Lisp).  Some are only a few years old (like Rust, Go, Clojure, and TypeScript).  There are several major styles of programming but the one that we will be using here in this course, and the style that is predominant all over, is called imperative programming.  In an imperative programming language, data values are stored in named locations in computer memory (called the program state) and programming language statements make changes\nto the program state. \nWe don't need to worry about the differences between imperative programming and other styles; that is for later courses.\nHowever, we do want to understand the major concepts that are in ALL imperative programming languages.\nThere are seven:\n  1)  data and types of data\n  2)  variables: saving data into memory for later use\n  3)  expressions: retrieving data back from memory and combining data to make new values\n  4)  repetition (looping)\n  5)  decision making (conditional statements)\n  6)  procedure abstraction (functions)\n  7)  simple data abstraction (arrays)\nThere is also a very important concept 8 that is in most modern programming languages (imperative as well as other styles):\n  8) everything abstraction (objects)\nObjects combine code and data in an abstraction that recapitulates a program itself.  Programming languages with this 8th concept are called \"object-oriented\" languages, and they enable object-oriented programming.\nWe will call these concepts \"The Great 8\".  As noted, all imperative programming languages have the first 7, and JavaScript has all 8.\nWe will be studying and practicing them one at a time as we move through the lesson modules.\nThe complexity of the programs we write will increase as we add each new concept to our repertoire.\nTo get credit for this overview, type this in the editor window:\n\n  alert ( \"The Great 8\" ) ;Once you have typed it, click on the \"test locally\" (orange) button.

It can affect the final valueof the expression, and can give erroneous results if we are not careful.\nYou may have learned a memory trick in math class pertaining to order of operation evaluation.  Remember PEMDAS?  These are what we call\noperator precedence rules.  The rules tell us which operators must precede which others during evaluation.\nThe rules are better written P-E-MD-AS I think, as there is no preference for M over D; likewise, no preference for A over S.\nAccording to PEMDAS, when we have an expression to evaluate, we first scan the expression left to right and do all the most deeply nested parentheses first\nas sub-expressions.  Then we scan left to right and do exponentiation.  Then we scan left to right and do all multiplication and division as we come to them.\nFinally, we scan left to right and do all addition and subtraction, as we come to them.\nIt pays to know PEMDAS, since JavaScript will evaluate expressions following those rules of operator precedence.

It seems strange because we cant multiply all the numbers from 0 down to 1\nwhich is what the factorial formula says to do.  So 0 is a special case and it is defined to be 1 to keep the laws of exponents working properly.\nIf you will go back to your factorial code that we did before, you will see that your code produces 0! as 1 also.\nThis works because we initialized the accumulator to 1 and then did no loop executions, leaving the final factorial 1.\nSo this program should use that code, and will also give a 1 as the result for this program if the user gives 0 as input.

Go to eBay, for example, and try to find and buy something you have in mind.\nYou first search for it (find all blue UNC coffee mugs) and then the sort the output (put them in order of lowest price to highest).\nSorting is for later (and perhaps a later class).  \nSearching is first.  Searching is the process of examining the data elements in a collection (arrays here) to see which elements match some criterion, or meet some requirement we have\nfor the needs of some computation. \"Find all elements in an array that are prime numbers\", or \"Find the first element in an array that is negative\", or \"check the elements in this\narray to see if they are all in alphabetic order\", or \"does this array of names contain someone named \"Jane Doe\".  These are examples of searches.  \nWe will be learning in this module how to systematically\ngo through an array, looking at every element slot-by-slot and comparing them to each other or to some value we are trying to match.\nMost of the searching we do in arrays will use for-loops.  This is because the array lengths are known and are convenient as loop control parameters.\nType in the following code to search in an array:\n\"use strict\";\n\nfunction myMain() {\n  var arr = [3,11,438,-21,895,67,1101,19,4.3,-6];\n  for (var i=0; i &lt; arr.length; i++) {\n    if ((arr[i]%3)===0) { \n      alert(arr[i] + \": multiple of 3\"); \n    }\n  }\n}\n\nmyMain();\nHere, the for loop allows us to examine the array slots in order, starting at 0 and going to the last slot in use.  Each time we do the loop body\nwe examine the slot number that the loop index variable \"i\" contains as value.  We are looking for multiples of 3, and if we find an array \nelement that is one, we print out that value.\n"

These are just suggestions.  Do not make the functions trivial (like myMain doing nothing but calling myMain2 for example).

This means a function is a \"value\" of some type (type \"function\") just as\n5 is a value of type number.  First class values can be assigned to variables.We are already familiar with this using number (or string) data. Consider this code:\n  var x = 8;\n  var y;\n  y = x;\n  alert(x);\n  alert(y);\nWe exect that 8 will get printed by each alert statement.  By assigning 8 to x, and then by assigning the contents of x to y, we expect that the variable \"y\" is, in essence,\na name for the value 8 just as \"x\" is a name for the value 8.  The value 8 is the same, no matter which name (variable) we use to denote the value.  Either way, using either variable,\nwe get the number value 8, the same value that we get when we double the number value 4.  There is only one number value 8, but we may denote it many different ways.\nNow consider this code:\n\"use strict\";\n\nfunction myMain ( ) {\n   alert( double(5) );\n}\n\nfunction double ( n ) {  return 2*n; }\n\nmyMain();\nIn this program we define a function \"double\" that takes one argument.  When called, function \"double\" multiplies its argument by 2 and returns that value.\nWe have defined using the \"function\" keyword that we are accustomed to using for function definitions.  Function \"myMain\" calls \"double\" on the number value 4 and \nalerts the returned result.\nNow let's add some code to myMain:\n\"use strict\";\n\nfunction myMain ( ) {\n  var dubble;\n  dubble = double; // assigns the function value bound to \"double\" to the name \"dubble\"\n  alert( double(5) );  // note by color that \"double\" is a global name\n  alert( dubble(5) );  // note by color that \"dubble\" is a local name inside myMain\n}\n\nfunction double ( n ) {  return 2*n; }\n\nmyMain();\nThis shows one function (the code that multiplies its argument by 2) with two different names (\"double\", and \"dubble\").\nWe can make that function code execute by calling it with the \"double\" name, or with the \"dubble\" name; we do both in this program.\nThis is the same thing we did before with a number value, except we have now done it with a function value.  The function value\nis the code that constitutes the definition, and that is executed when the function runs.  We say that the names \"double\" and\n\"dubble\" are bound to the function value.  One way to bind a name to a function value is with the \"function keyword\".\nNow we see that another way is to take the function value that one name denotes and bind it to another name via assignment.\nSince the function \"double\" is declared at the global level, the name \"double\" is visible inside myMain, and can be used inside myMain.\nIf \"double\" were not visible inside myMain we could not call the function.  Since it is visible, we can not only call it to make\nit execute, but we can assign it to some other variable.  Then we have two \"names\" for the one function value (the function that\nmultiplies its single argument by 2 and returns that value).  The function value is not the name -- it is the code.\nTo get credit for this overview, put the last code (with \"double\" and \"dubble\") in your editor window and \nsubmit it for scoring.\n"

The base case will usually be a test to see if the parameter is some smallest value.\nThe base case is very important.

Writing the book is not the same as reading it.\nExeuction:Once defined, we can then call  the function -- request that the function execute to do some computing work for us.  \nBy typing the function name with parentheses after, we make the instructions in a function definition actually run and generate results.\nTo complete this problem, first type the following function definition: \n\"use strict\";\n function fooFiver ( ) { alert(5); }  // function definition\nClick on the \"run locally\" button.

Use the new \"myMain style format\".As you may have noticed, a program can be written several different ways, yet still generate the same output values. The way program statements are organized we call \"structural style\".  Some styles are better than others.  Some program structures are easier to modify without making mistakes, for example.  Some structural styles are easier for groups of programmers to work on without interfering with each other.\nFrom now on (unless we specify otherwise) your programs should be constructed with the following structural style: \n&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp -- Write a function called \"myMain\" with no arguments.  &nbsp&nbsp&nbsp -- Put your code inside this function.  &nbsp&nbsp&nbsp -- Put the call myMain(); as the last line in your code, after the function definition.This structural style means your programs will be built as one (or more) function definition, and one call to myMain() to get the snowball rolling.\nAs we get to more complicated programs, we will have more than one function definition. However we will always have a function\nmyMain defined and the call myMain() to start it all off.\nThis sort of structural style is called a \"coding convention\", meaning it is not something the language requires, but rather is an agreement to adhere to \na specific form.  Our myMain convention says all code will be nothing but function definitions, and one call ( myMain() ).  I will be showing reasons for that in the videos ahead.  For now, the first reason is that other languages like Java have more rigid structure rules than JavaScript, so if we follow this convention you will be more ready to move to other languages.  Another reason is if we limit some of the choices you need to make, you can concentrate on practicing the principles with less potential confusion.  Finally, a third reason is to limit the use of global variables; you don't know what this means yet but we are getting there.\nThere are many coding conventions in use in all areas of programming language structure.  Some programmers start all variable name with lower case, for example, and use upper case characters to delineate words in a variable name (like distanceTraveled, or timeTakenForTheGame). Others might like to use underscores (like distance_traveled, or time_taken_for_the_game).   Indenting code to make it readable is another place where different coding conventions are used.  Some programmers like to create object names that start with an upper case character.  Pick a style and stick to it.  Your code will be more readable that way.\n"

Then loop, asking the user for a base pair (as a string of 2 characters) and print the number of times that base pair occurs in the DNA sequence (using the output format below).\nDetails follow.\n \nA DNA sequence representation is a string composed entirely of the capital letter \"A\", \"C\", \"T\", and \"G\".  For example, each of the following lines represents a DNA sequence:\nACATGAGACAGACAGACCCCCAGAGACAGACCCCTAGACACAGAGAGAG\nTATGCAGGACAGGGTTTTTGCCCAGGGTGGCAGTATG\nAGGATTGAGGTATGGGTATGTTCCCGATTGAGTAGCCAGTATGAGCCAG\nAGTTTTTTACAAGTATTTTTCCCAGTAGCCAGAGAGAGAGTCACCCAGT\nThe following are sample executions:\nWhat DNA sequence?

In this string\nCCCC\nwe are saying that \"CC\" occurs 3 times (not 2).  We do not count the first two characters as a match, and then move on to the 3rd character.  Rather we start with the first \"C and notice that there is a \"C\" following it, for the first match.  We move on to the 2nd character, which is a \"C\" and we note a \"C\" following it (for the 2nd match).  We move on to the 3rd character, which is a \"C\", and we note a \"C\" following it (for the 3rd match).  I am not sure if this is how biologists count these things, but that is how we will do it here for this program.  We call it a \"sliding window\"\nthat is sliding one character at a time.  For fun, you can try\nwriting your own program where the string \"CCCC\" would produce 2 matches... a sliding window that slides to the end of any match it finds to keep going.\nString functions:There are a couple string functions you may find useful.\nFirst, the function \" split \" will take a string and produce (return) an array of individual characters, one character from the string stored in each slot location in the array.\nA string value in JavaScript is an object, and \"split\" is a method that can be called on the object.  For example consider this code:\nvar str = \"go heels!\";\nchars = str.split(\"\");\nalert(chars[0]);  // will print \"g\"\nalert(chars[1]);  // will print \"o\"\nalert(chars[2]);  // will print \" \"  a blank character\nalert(chars[3]);  // will print \"h\"\nalert(chars[str.length - 1]);   // will print \"!\"\nHere, using the parameter \"\" in the call to the split method causes the string to be burst apart into individual characters.  The split method can be used to split strings into\nother chunks based on other characters; google it up for more information.\nAnother possibly useful string method is \" charAt \".  This string method will produce (return) a single character, the one found at a specific position in the \nstring. Character positions in a string start at 0 and go up to one less than the length of the string.  For example consider this code:\n var bp = \"AG\" ;\n var first = bp.charAt(0);\n var second = bp.charAt(1);\n var last = bp.charAt(bp.length - 1);\n alert(first);    // prints \"A\"\n alert(second);  // prints \"G\"\n alert(last);    // prints \"G\"\nOther challenges: As further practice, you can alter how searching is done and try coding different versions of this program (for practice, not for score).\nFor example, only count a base pair if it occurs within 10 (or 20, or some limit) characters of some other base pair.  Or dont count a base pair if it immediately follows an \noccurrence of itself.  Or count base pair pairs... if the base pair is AT for example, then look for ATAT and count that.  Make up your own search pattern and code it up.\n"

In World War II the mansion housed the Government Code and Cypher Schools and was the main location for British intelligence codebreakers.  The men and women working there regularly penetrated the secret communications of the Axis Powers – most importantly the German Enigma and Lorenz ciphers. The intelligence gathered at Bletchley was termed \"Ultra\" and historians general consider the work to have shortened the war by two to four years. Without it, the outcome of the war would have been uncertain.\nThe Enigma cipher was a German code used before and during WW2.  It was largely considered unbreakable (in pre-computer days) but that was not so.  Polish mathematicians learned how early forms of the code worked, but breaking it became impractical at the outbreak of WW2 as the Germans added complexity to the basic machines, and changes keys daily.  Due to the huge number of combinations used in how the characters were transposed during encoding, decoding rapidly was nearly impossible.  Alan Turing, working at Bletchley in Britain, created a machine (the Bombe) that was able to reduce the possible combinations down to a number where crypt-analysts were able to decipher coded messages.  Breaking the Enigma code enabled the British to gather very important intelligence that is often credited with tipping the war in favor of the Allied forces and shortening it by several years.

            "text": "Write a program that will compute a simple form of the well-know Caesar cipher, using details given following.Details follow.\n \nLet's delve a little into the world of cryptography.  Cryptography is the study of how we can make messages (text) unreadable without special knowledge (which we presume\nthe recipient of the message has, and others dont have).  A \"cipher\" is an algorithm for encoding (and decoding) a message.  We call the original message the \"plain text\" \nand we call the encoded message the \"cipher text\".  We call the secret knowledge needed to encode and decode messages the \"key\" (or keys).\nWe want a cipher to be efficient when encoding and decoding messages (if we have the key), and impossible (or computationally impractical) to \"break\". \nBreaking a cipher is figuring out how to read a message without having the key... or by guessing the key.\nA Caesar cipher is a simple substitution cipher that most of us probably learned to do as children.  \nIt was reputedly for used by Julius Caesar to secure his communications during his military and political activities.\nIn a substitution cipher, the cipher text is produced\nfrom the plain text by substituting each character with a new character.\nThe new character is obtained from the alphabet shifted some fixed number of places.  For simplicity, our examples will show \nonly upper case characters.  Consider a left-shift-5 cipher, where we have these alphabets:\n  plain:  A B C D E F G H I J K L M N O P Q R S T U V W X Y Z\n cipher:  F G H I J K L M N O P Q R S T U V W X Y Z A B C D E\nThe shift amount is called the \"key\", which is 5 in this example.  I will call it a left-shift because we take the alphabet and shift it to the left, moving A,,B,C etc around to the Z end.  Thus the 6th letter in the unshifted alphabet (\"F\") becomes the first letter after we shift left 5 times.\nWith this done, we can encode messages by seeing what character corresponds to each character in the plain text (by position in the sequence).\nIf the plain text has an \"A\" character, we put a \"F\" character into the cipher text.  We see in the shifted alphabet table above \nthat \"F\" is below \"A\".  When we find a blank in the plain text, we put a blank into the cipher text.  Here is a full example:\nGO TAR HEELS   ---> LT YFW MJJQX\nNotice we encoded only the non-blank characters, leaving the blanks unchanged.  This gives a decoder some advantage, since the word boundaries are known in\nthe ciphertext.\nWe can make the cipher a touch harder to break by adding the \" \" blank into the character sequence, so that we cannot look at the cipher text and see word breaks and word lengths directly.  We will explore this idea in the next problem.\nSo let's first implement this simple Caesar cipher (with unchanged blanks).  \nFor input, first ask the user for a key.  This will be the shift amount (and implicitly, the direction). \nThe key should be an integer between 1 and 25.  We will disallow a 0 shift (for obvious reasons) and we also\ncannot have a shift larger than 25  (since shifting 26 is like shifting 0, shifting 27 is like shifting 1, etc.).  \nWe will consider all shifts to be left (as shown above); if we wanted to shift right, we can find a left shift key that would give the same encoding (for example, left-shift-5 is the same as right-shift-20).  Validate this input to make sure it is an integer in the allowed range; use the re-ask strategy... we will alert\n\"try again\" and re-ask until the user gives a good integer value.\nOnce we have a good key, we will ask the user for a text message to encode.  For simplicity we will limit ourselves to working with upper case\ncharacters A to Z, and the blank character \" \".  We will not have any digits or punctuation characters in the message.  \nUse this ordering for the alphabet characters:\nA B C D E F G H I J K L M N O P Q R S T U V W X Y Z\nWe will assume the user gives us text that has no digits or punctuation.  We can make things a bit easier on the user by converting the input string \nto all upper case in our code; this will allow the user to type with upper and lower case, but we can still work with only upper case.  \nTo convert a string to all upper case, use the \"toUpperCase()\" string methods, as follows:\n  var msg = \"Hello Tarheels lets beat Duke\";\n  msg = msg.toUpperCase();\n  // at this point the variable msg contains the string \"HELLO TARHEELS LETS BEAT DUKE\"\nApply the cipher (using the key) to the plain text to produce a cipher text.  For output, print the single string which is the cipher text.  Use one alert statement to do this.\nApplying the cipher:Notes:There are several string methods you will find helpful. Particularly, we have methods that will take a string and create an array of individual characters.\nWe also have a method that will take an array of characters and produce a single string composed of those characters. \nWe studied the \"split\" method earlier. If you call the split method on a string and pass\nan empty character as parameter, the split will burst the string into an array of individual characters:\n  var msg = \"one two three\";\n  var arr = msg.split(\"\");\n  // now arr[0] is \"o\", arr[1] is \"n\", arr[2] is \"e\", arr[3] is \" \", etc.\n\n  msg = arr.join( \"\" );  // this puts the empty string \"\" between the elements in the arrary \"arr\" and makes a single string\n  // now msg is un-burst, and made back into a single string\nOur strategy will be to burst apart the plaintext string into an array (with \"split\" on string), change the individual characters in the resulting array, \nthen \"string-ify\" the changed array of characters back  into a single string (with \"join\" on the array) to get the final cipher text.\nBreaking the Caesar Cipher:How could be break this simple cipher?  If we intercept an encoded message, we do not know just by looking at it that a Caesar cipher was used to encode it.\nIt will just look like gibberish.  If we *did* know it was a Caesar cipher, breaking it is simple... we just try each possible key 1 up to 25 and see which one\nproduces a readable plain text.  So we see here one weakness: there are so few possible keys that we can do an exhaustive trial of all of them.\nAlso, trying each key is computationally cheap.  So stronger ciphers must defend against exhaustive search attacks by have an impractically huge number of\npossible keys.\nGuessing that our intercepted message was encoded with a Caesar cipher is a different problem.\n"

We will do what is called a \"key rotation\", meaning we will\nincrease the key value, and that increase will happen every so many characters.  For this variant, we will fix this period at 5 characters, and we will\nincrement the key value by one.  In a later version we can add more input parameters and allow the user to specify how much to increment the key,\nafter how many characters go by.\nSo let's implement this rotating key cipher.

            "text": "Parsing: Decomposing text strings \nIn this module we will learn a little about \"parsing\", which is breaking up text strings into pieces... into a collection of smaller strings, or components.\nParsing is part of many computing applications.  For example, in order to execute your JavaScript program, a compiler or interpreter must take the \nsingle text string that is your program and find all the important substring pieces... components like the keywords \"function\" and \"true\" and \"while\"... \nvariable names, and number constants... all parts within the one long program string.  \nWe will see how to do a simple form of this using some JavaScript built-in string functions.\nThe string type in JavaScript has some built-in methods (functions) that you can ask any string to execute.  \nThe one we will use to parse is the \"split\" function.  You should google \"JavaScript string split\" and read the\ndetails.  It takes a parameter, which is a single character; and it returns an array of strings.  The split functions will break the string that executes it into parts using \nthe character that is sent as parameter to define the boundaries between parts; the parts will be placed into successive locations in the array that is returned.\nFor example, consider this code:\nvar long = \"alpha beta gamma\";\nvar parts= long.split(\" \");\nThe second line causes the string \"long\" to be divided into 3 substrings using the blank as the separator.  This means the array \"parts\" has \"alpha\" in parts[0], \"beta\" in parts[1].\nand \"gamma\" stored in parts[2].  Try this code, and alert elements from the array \"parts\" to see how split works.\nThe split function can divide a string using any character as the break point, not just a blank. For example, if you want to get a string of data (from a database, perhaps) and it\nconsists of several numbers separates by commas, you can break the data string down this way:\nvar data = \"123,24.571,15,-37.2,0.01\" ;\nvar nums = data.split(\",\");\nalert(nums[0]);\nalert(nums[3]);\nIf you try this code, you will see the numbers \"123\" and \"-37\" printed out in separate alert boxes.\nNote that the elements in the array \"nums\" are still strings (that look like numbers). If you need real numeric data you still need to convert\nthe string data to number data (with the Number() function).\nTo see this, run the code above and add these lines at the end:\nalert(nums[0]+nums[1]);  // string concatenation\nalert(Number(nums[0]) + Number(nums[1]));  // numerical arithmetic\nTo complete this overview, type in the following program, execute it, then submit it for score.\n\"use strict\";\n\nfunction myMain() {\n  var text = \"see how parsing breaks up strings\";\n  var arr = text.split(\" \");\n  alert(arr[2]);\n  alert(arr[3]);\n  alert(arr[arr.length-1]);\n}\n\nmyMain();\n"

If the user gives the string \"end\"  then input is finished, so the\nprogram should alert \"done\" and end.  If the user gives any other string, then your program will parse that\nstring twice by sending it to the spam filter object, and also sending it to the phishing filter object.  We send a string to the filter objects by calling\nthe \"parse\" method in each and passing the string as a parameter.  First parse the string with the spam filter, and then after that parse it with the phishing filter.\nOrder will matter (for this program) since each filter will be doing some output (if it detects something to report).\nmakeSpamFilter: This constructor will take no parameters, and will return an object that can detect spam (a simple filter).\nIt will have these methods:\nparse ( string ) : this method take one parameter (a string) and will return a boolean.  It will return true is it detects the spam patterns it looks for, and return false otherwise.\nIt will also increment a spam counter in the object if it detects the spam patterns.  It increments a total strings analyzed counter no matter what it finds.\nreportTotal( ) : this method will return an integer that is how many messages the object has parsed (how many times the parse method was called).\nreportHits( ) : this method returns an integer, which tells how many times the parse method was called AND returned a true (i.e. found spam in the message that\nwas parsed).\nreportPercentage( ) : this method returns a number between 0 and 100 that tells the percentage of messages parsed that were phishing (it returns hits divided by total, \nthen multiplied by 100 to make is a percentage).  Note: watch for divide by zero... if the number of hits is 0, you will have to return 0 directly as the percentage rather\nthan trying to compute it with a zero divide.\nmakePhishFilter: This constructor will take no parameters, and will return an object that can detect phishing (a simple filter).\nIt will have these methods:\nparse ( string ) : this method take one parameter (a string) and will return a boolean.  It will return true is it detects the spam patterns it looks for, and return false otherwise.\nIt will also increment a spam counter in the object if it detects the spam patterns.  It increments a total strings analyzed counter no matter what it finds.\nreportTotal( ) : this method will return an integer that is how many messages the object has parsed (how many times the parse method was called).\nreportHits( ) : this method returns an integer, which tells how many times the parse method was called AND returned a true (i.e. found phishing patterns in the message that\nwas parsed).\nreportPercentage( ) : this method returns a number between 0 and 100 that tells the percentage of messages parsed that were spam (it returns hits divided by total, \nthen multiplied by 100 to make is a percentage). Note: watch for divide by zero... if the number of hits is 0, you will have to return 0 directly as the percentage rather\nthan trying to compute it with a zero divide.\nNote that the two objects are almost identical in structure... each has methods with the same name and type signatures.\nThe differences between the two objects are in the patterns that are being looked for during parsing.  This means the \"parse\" \nmethod will be different inside each object.\nOutput:There are three times in your code that output will (or might) be done.\nFirst, for each string input by the user, if it parses out with spam patterns (if the spam filter object returns \"true\" from the parse method) then\nalert \"spam\".  \nThen, if that same string parses out with phishing patterns (if the phishing filter object returns \"true\" from the parse method) then\nalert \"phish\" in a separate alert statement. \nThus each text string given by the user might cause one, two, or zero alert boxes.\nFinally, after the user give \"end\"  to signal no more input strings, there should be two more alerts done.  The first tells the percentage of input strings\nthat were spam.  The second tells the percentage of input strings that were phishing.  Remember that any one input string might trigger both filters, so \nthe percentages wont necessarily add up as you might think they should.\nWhat is spam?Here is how the spam filter will parse... the patterns to look for.\nFirst, break the text into tokens by splitting on \" \" blanks.  Then check to see if there are any of these strings in the\ntoken array: \"meds\",  \"mortgage\", \"loan\".\nThen check for some pairs (like we did in the previous DIY): declare the text to be spam if there is the token \"interest\" followed immediately by token \"rate\".\nAlso, declare it spam if the token \"credit\" is followed by token \"card\".\nWhat is phishing?Here is how the phish filter will parse... the patterns to look for.\nFirst break the text into chunks separated by \"#\" hashtags.\nThen within each chunk, further break it into tokens by \" \" blank as separator. Examine those tokens\nand declare the original text a phishing attempt if tokens any are these strings: \"login\", \"password\", \"verify\"\nSample executions:Input string?  #welcome to our homepage#please login#you can get a lower interest rate just give your password\nspam\nphish\nInput string? go tarheels fight win beat dook\nInput string? Need a low cost mortgage then call us\nspam\nInput string? #email header cs.unc.edu #reply-to: postmaster@cs.unc.edu #no reply no forward\nInput string? end\n50% spam\n25% phish\nInput string? end\n0% spam\n0% phish\nInput string? header#login field followed#easy term credit card low interest rate for 6 months\nspam\nphish\nInput string?

We are going to be doing more like this in the last month.\nAs you work on this one do not worry about the length.  This one will seem long but remember that there are two object constructors,\nand one is nearly the same as the other.  One plan is to write one object constructor, get it working (test it locally!), and then\ncopy it to start the second constructor function.  Make the needed changes to the \"parse\" method in the second constructor.\n"

CC\nBase pair 'CC' occurs 5 times in DNA sequence 'ACATCCTGAGACAGACAGACCCCCAGA'\nWhat base pair? done\nNote how we are counting occurrences.  In this string\nCCCC\nwe are saying that \"CC\" occurs 3 times (not 2).  We do not count the first two characters as a match, and then move on to the 3rd character.  Rather we start with the first \"C and notice that there is a \"C\" following it, for the first match.  We move on to the 2nd character, which is a \"C\" and we note a \"C\" following it (for the 2nd match).  We move on to the 3rd character, which is a \"C\", and we note a \"C\" following it (for the 3rd match).  I am not sure if this is how biologists count these things, but that is how we will do it here for this program.  We call it a \"sliding window\"\nthat is sliding one character at a time.  For fun, you can try\nwriting your own program where the string \"CCCC\" would produce 2 matches... a sliding window that slides to the end of any match it finds to keep going.\nString functions:There are a couple string functions you may find useful.\nFirst, the function \" split \" will take a string and produce (return) an array of individual characters, one character from the string stored in each slot location in the array.\nA string value in JavaScript is an object, and \"split\" is a method that can be called on the object.  For example consider this code:\nvar str = \"go heels!\";\nchars = str.split(\"\");\nalert(chars[0]);  // will print \"g\"\nalert(chars[1]);  // will print \"o\"\nalert(chars[2]);  // will print \" \"  a blank character\nalert(chars[3]);  // will print \"h\"\nalert(chars[str.length - 1]);   // will print \"!\"\nHere, using the parameter \"\" in the call to the split method causes the string to be burst apart into individual characters.  The split method can be used to split strings into\nother chunks based on other characters; google it up for more information.\nAnother possibly useful string method is \" charAt \".  This string method will produce (return) a single character, the one found at a specific position in the \nstring. Character positions in a string start at 0 and go up to one less than the length of the string.  For example consider this code:\n var bp = \"AG\" ;\n var first = bp.charAt(0);\n var second = bp.charAt(1);\n var last = bp.charAt(bp.length - 1);\n alert(first);    // prints \"A\"\n alert(second);  // prints \"G\"\n alert(last);    // prints \"G\"\nOther challenges: As further practice, you can alter how searching is done and try coding different versions of this program (for practice, not for score).\nFor example, only count a base pair if it occurs within 10 (or 20, or some limit) characters of some other base pair.  Or dont count a base pair if it immediately follows an \noccurrence of itself.  Or count base pair pairs... if the base pair is AT for example, then look for ATAT and count that.  Make up your own search pattern and code it up.\n"

            "text": "Write a program that will compute a simple form of the well-know Caesar cipher, using details given following.Details follow.\n \nLet's delve a little into the world of cryptography.  Cryptography is the study of how we can make messages (text) unreadable without special knowledge (which we presume\nthe recipient of the message has, and others dont have).  A \"cipher\" is an algorithm for encoding (and decoding) a message.  We call the original message the \"plain text\" \nand we call the encoded message the \"cipher text\".  We call the secret knowledge needed to encode and decode messages the \"key\" (or keys).\nWe want a cipher to be efficient when encoding and decoding messages (if we have the key), and impossible (or computationally impractical) to \"break\". \nBreaking a cipher is figuring out how to read a message without having the key... or by guessing the key.\nA Caesar cipher is a simple substitution cipher that most of us probably learned to do as children.  \nIt was reputedly for used by Julius Caesar to secure his communications during his military and political activities.\nIn a substitution cipher, the cipher text is produced\nfrom the plain text by substituting each character with a new character.\nThe new character is obtained from the alphabet shifted some fixed number of places.  For simplicity, our examples will show \nonly upper case characters.  Consider a left-shift-5 cipher, where we have these alphabets:\n  plain:  A B C D E F G H I J K L M N O P Q R S T U V W X Y Z\n cipher:  F G H I J K L M N O P Q R S T U V W X Y Z A B C D E\nThe shift amount is called the \"key\", which is 5 in this example.  I will call it a left-shift because we take the alphabet and shift it to the left, moving A,,B,C etc around to the Z end.  Thus the 6th letter in the unshifted alphabet (\"F\") becomes the first letter after we shift left 5 times.\nWith this done, we can encode messages by seeing what character corresponds to each character in the plain text (by position in the sequence).\nIf the plain text has an \"A\" character, we put a \"F\" character into the cipher text.  We see in the shifted alphabet table above \nthat \"F\" is below \"A\".  When we find a blank in the plain text, we put a blank into the cipher text.  Here is a full example:\nGO TAR HEELS   ---> LT YFW MJJQX\nNotice we encoded only the non-blank characters, leaving the blanks unchanged.  This gives a decoder some advantage, since the word boundaries are known in\nthe ciphertext.\nWe can make the cipher a touch harder to break by adding the \" \" blank into the character sequence, so that we cannot look at the cipher text and see word breaks and word lengths directly.  We will explore this idea in the next problem.\nSo let's first implement this simple Caesar cipher (with unchanged blanks).  \nFor input, first ask the user for a key.  This will be the shift amount (and implicitly, the direction). \nThe key should be an integer between 1 and 25.  We will disallow a 0 shift (for obvious reasons) and we also\ncannot have a shift larger than 25  (since shifting 26 is like shifting 0, shifting 27 is like shifting 1, etc.).  \nWe will consider all shifts to be left (as shown above); if we wanted to shift right, we can find a left shift key that would give the same encoding (for example, left-shift-5 is the same as right-shift-20).  Validate this input to make sure it is an integer in the allowed range; use the re-ask strategy... we will alert\n\"try again\" and re-ask until the user gives a good integer value.\nOnce we have a good key, we will ask the user for a text message to encode.  For simplicity we will limit ourselves to working with upper case\ncharacters A to Z, and the blank character \" \".  We will not have any digits or punctuation characters in the message.  \nUse this ordering for the alphabet characters:\nA B C D E F G H I J K L M N O P Q R S T U V W X Y Z\nWe will assume the user gives us text that has no digits or punctuation.  We can make things a bit easier on the user by converting the input string \nto all upper case in our code; this will allow the user to type with upper and lower case, but we can still work with only upper case.  \nTo convert a string to all upper case, use the \"toUpperCase()\" string methods, as follows:\n  var msg = \"Hello Tarheels lets beat Duke\";\n  msg = msg.toUpperCase();\n  // at this point the variable msg contains the string \"HELLO TARHEELS LETS BEAT DUKE\"\nApply the cipher (using the key) to the plain text to produce a cipher text.  For output, print the single string which is the cipher text.  Use one alert statement to do this.\nApplying the cipher:Notes:There are several string methods you will find helpful. Particularly, we have methods that will take a string and create an array of individual characters.\nWe also have a method that will take an array of characters and produce a single string composed of those characters. \nWe studied the \"split\" method earlier. If you call the split method on a string and pass\nan empty character as parameter, the split will burst the string into an array of individual characters:\n  var msg = \"one two three\";\n  var arr = msg.split(\"\");\n  // now arr[0] is \"o\", arr[1] is \"n\", arr[2] is \"e\", arr[3] is \" \", etc.\n\n  msg = arr.join( \"\" );  // this puts the empty string \"\" between the elements in the arrary \"arr\" and makes a single string\n  // now msg is un-burst, and made back into a single string\nOur strategy will be to burst apart the plaintext string into an array (with \"split\" on string), change the individual characters in the resulting array, \nthen \"string-ify\" the changed array of characters back  into a single string (with \"join\" on the array) to get the final cipher text.\nBreaking the Caesar Cipher:How could be break this simple cipher?  If we intercept an encoded message, we do not know just by looking at it that a Caesar cipher was used to encode it.\nIt will just look like gibberish.  If we *did* know it was a Caesar cipher, breaking it is simple... we just try each possible key 1 up to 25 and see which one\nproduces a readable plain text.  So we see here one weakness: there are so few possible keys that we can do an exhaustive trial of all of them.\nAlso, trying each key is computationally cheap.  So stronger ciphers must defend against exhaustive search attacks by have an impractically huge number of\npossible keys.\nGuessing that our intercepted message was encoded with a Caesar cipher is a different problem.\n"

We will do what is called a \"key rotation\", meaning we will\nincrease the key value, and that increase will happen every so many characters.  For this variant, we will fix this period at 5 characters, and we will\nincrement the key value by one.  In a later version we can add more input parameters and allow the user to specify how much to increment the key,\nafter how many characters go by.\nSo let's implement this rotating key cipher. As before we will ask the user for the key, an integer between 1 and the length of the character set minus 1.\nWe will validate this input using the re-ask strategy... if the input is bad, we will alert \"try again\" and re-ask until the user gives a good integer value.\nOnce we have a good key, we will ask the user for a message to encode.  This will be a string composed of upper case alphabetic characters, digits, the \" \" blank,  \nthe \".\" period character, and the \",\" comma.\nUse this ordering:\n0 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 . , ; : ? !

For the rotating cipher the main changes will be in determining when the\nkey should change, and making the proper change. Remember... the key cant get larger than the length of the character set, so\nas the key is incremented there must be some modular arithmetic done to keep it in range.\nOne thing to watch for when rotating the key.  When the key get to the end of the alphabet... like 25 (for a 26 character set), we are using modular arithmetic to make sure\nwe stay in range.

We want to do the same statistics computations we did before, but now we want to do it \nmore than once.  The number of times we will repeat the Wall 1 stats solver will be told to us by the user (as the first input).\nSo, first ask the user to input a non-negative integer (zero or larger, and can assume the user gives us a good integer in the proper range... we will not worry about validating input in this program).  The user's number tells us how many times we need to repeat the stats solver.  This means 0 or more times\nwe will repeat this procedure (which you have Wall 1 code to do already):\n  -- ask for 5 numbers\n  -- compute sum, avg, min, max, ratio \n  -- print out the results\nAfter asking the user for that first number (the repeat count), you should identify each repetition by printing this before running the Wall 1 code:\nStats Solver execution 1 ====================\nThe 1 will be replaced each time it is run with the proper iteration count.

This means myMain and one other function.\nThis to to emphasize to you that writing and using functions is a good way to organize your code AND to make use of code you already have.\nIn this case, you have the solution to Wall 1 that does the stats solver.  You have to run that code several times (based on user input).\nThe way to organize this is to write your Wall 1 code as a function.\nThen in myMain for Wall 2, you put some user input (how many times to execute), and a for loop, and in the body of the loop\nto call the function that does the Wall 1 stats solver.  The various output decorations can also go in the looping code for myMain.\nThe code for the Wall 1 solver does not have to be changed... just wrapped in a function definition so it can be called.\n"

            "text": "Basic 7-Operation Calculator We will write a program that will perform repeated addition, subtraction, multiplication, division, square roots, squaring, and truncation at the direction of user input.\nHere is how it will work.\nThe calculator will have one variable that contains the current \"answer\".  When you first run your program this will start with 0 in it.\nPrint this answer and begin the main loop. The main loop will ask the user for an operation (and perhaps a number, depending on\nthe operation requested), and will perform that operation using the current answer (and the users number) and report the new answer.  \nSo the calculator will be keeping a running total, so to speak.\nIn the main loop, first ask the user for an operation to perform.  \nThe user will type \"a\", \"s\", \"m\", \"d\", \"rt\", \"tr\", \"sq\", or \"q\" to indicate add, subtract, multiply, divide, square root, truncate, square, or quit.\nIf the user gives a \"q\" end the loop, print \"done\", and end the program.  Otherwise perform the requested operation.\nFor some operations, this requires asking the user for a number  (for a, s, m, d ).\nDo whatever operation the user has requested  to the current  \"answer\" \nwith the number given by the user.  Print the current answer.  \nThen loop back and ask the user for another operation (and perhaps another number).\nFor \"rt\" square root, call Math.sqrt on the total (after checking to make sure the total is not negative... see errors below).\nFor \"tr\" truncate, use the function \"trunc\" that you wrote in module \"utility functions\".  \nInput validation: You must validate all inputs from the user.  For the operation if the user gives anything other than one of the 8 acceptable strings,\nprint \"bad op\" and end the program.  For a number, if the user gives something that is not a number print \"bad num\" and end\nexecution.  \nThen there are a couple of other errors that might happen.  These will not end the program, but instead will cause the calculator to\nsimply ignore the bad value and loop back to the \"get an operation\" part of the code.\nFirst, watch for zero-divide.  If the user asks for the divide operation, then make sure the number given is not a 0 (mathematically,\ndivide by 0 is not defined).  If the user gives a 0 after asking for divide, then print the message \"zero div\" and simply don't do the division into the answer \n(in other words, leave the answer unchanged).  Print the answer just like you would after the other operations, and keep on going.\nJust to be clear: Catching a divide-by-zero error does not end the program, it simply makes you tell the user, and skip doing the\noperation.\nNext, if the user asks for \"rt\" square root, you must check to make sure the current running total is non-negative.\nIf the current total is negative, print \"neg total\" and don't do anything to the answer. Like with zero divide, simply print the total (unchanged) and\nget the next operation.  As with zero divide, do not end the program.\nHere are some sample executions to see how the program should work:\n0\nwhat operation? a\nwhat number? 12\n12\nwhat operation? m\nwhat number? 2\n24\nwhat operation? s\nwhat number? 3.5\n20.5\nwhat operation? d\nwhat number? 4\n5.125\nwhat operation? d\nwhat number? 0\nzero div\n5.125\nwhat operation? a\nwhat number? 3.875\n9\nwhat operation? rt\n3\nwhat operation? s\nwhat number? 7\n-4\nwhat operation? rt\nneg total\n-4\nwhat operation? sq\n16\nwhat operation? rt\n4\nwhat operation? q\ndone\n0\nwhat operation? a\nwhat number? 34.5678\n34.5678\nwhat operation? d\nwhat number? 10\n3.4567799999999997\nwhat operation? tr\n3\nwhat operation? q\ndone\nStyle:As always make sure you use the myMain function format.\nThis program should be written with one loop, and make it is the right form of loop\n(for loop or while loop, you decide) for the situation (we have an indefinite situation... we are looping until the user says \"q\"\nand we don't know when that will be).\nRemember to convert input to number when needed. You may write functions other than myMain if you wish.\nIn fact, you will have at least 2 top level functions (myMain, and trunc).\nSoftware engineering suggestions:1) As we have noted before, do not write a ton of lines and then test... and hope for the best.\nWrite a few lines, and test... see if it is doing what you think it should.  Then add more lines.\nWrite your smaller functions first, and then test them separately.\nAlso you can try writing your main program without validation... just assume the user (you) will give proper input.  Then you can check the main\nlogic with good inputs.  Once that is working, you can then go back and add validation code and make the program more robust.\n2) Write the calculator part... the part the handles the operations... by putting in one or two operations and getting it to work.  Maybe get \"a\" and \"s\" \nto work, and test it well.  The go back and add in another operation... then another. \nThink of yourself as building the program, not writing it.  Build it one little piece at a time, and test as you go to make sure\nthe pieces you add work as you think they should.\n"

Then use your solution to findtwin primes in that range.

While it is not the most efficient way to generate primes, but it is not too bad.\nFull problem description is \nfound here.\nComputer Science note.Generating primes is one side of an important computer science area.  The other side is the problem\ncalled primality testing, or answering this question: is this number prime?Primality testing is hard, and it gets harder very rapidly as the number we want to test gets larger.  \nThe difficulty of primality testing is what makes the area of cryptography useful.  We can make codes\nthat cannot easily be broken by computer.  This allows safe transmission of messages over the internet (for example) without\nthem being succeptible to interception and de-coding.  Messages like the password to your bank\naccount when you do online banking.\nCan't we primality test with our Sieve?Theoretically we can.  If we want to test a number like (say) 1,001,317,234,144,788,210,001 for primality we could simply \ngenerate the sieve to get ALL primes between 1 and 1,001,317,234,144,788,210,001, and of course then do a quick check to see if\n1,001,317,234,144,788,210,001 in in our sieve.  \nBut theory slams into practice, as it did with our number guessing game.  The amount of time and space (the array) it would take to compute \nthe sieve for such a large number  is hugely prohibitive... making it impossible in a practical sense.  The number shown above is about 10^20, or\nabout a billion trillions.  It would take an array that was the size of the total amount of main memory in hundreds of billions of laptops.  It would take an\narray that is the size of a 16 billion 1-terabyte disk drives (if numbers take 16 bytes to represent ).\n"

            "text": "Methods: Functions inside objects \nObjects are the capstone item in the list of the Great 8 concepts we find in all object-oriented programming languages.\nUp to now, we have seen that an object is a way of binding data values (\"fields\") together so that they remain\nassociated for a common purpose... such as representing different pieces of information about a person\n(name, age, address, pay rate, hours worked, etc.).\nNow we will see that functions can also be fields in an object.   We call a function inside an object a \"method\" of that object.\nThus, an object binds together data fields, and functions (methods)\nthat operate on those data fields.  This makes an object an abstraction of a program in general.\nWe can think of our \"programs\" as collections of objects that call each others' methods in order to get work done.\nThe methods inside an object will allow us to think of an object as being able to do work for us.\nIn previous programs, we had an object constructor \"makePersonObject\" that would create an object that\nrepresented a worker at a company.  The object had a field that told how many hours that person worked, and a field that\ntold the pay rate the person earned per hour. To compute the amount of pay the person earned, we directly accessed the hours field and the payrate field in \nthe object, retrieved their values, and multiplied those values together.  We did this in the problem \"Construct person object\"   in module \"Basic Objects\" if you would like\nto refer back to the code.\nNow, we will be able to add a method (function) to the person object so that the person object can do that computation internally, where the hours and payrate fields are kept \n(we will do this in one of the following problems).  We can then\nhave a person object do that work for us, and simply report the total pay in response to our code elsewhere calling a function (a method) in the object.\nIn essence, we will contact the object and get it to do what we were doing in our code before, but now we do not have to remember the details\nof what the internal data fields are named.  We let the object worry about that in the \"pay\" function, and we simple call that function and wait for the results.\nWe will not look inside the object at its data fields.  The syntax for this will be:\n  var persObj = makePersonObject();\n  var totalPay = personObj.pay();\nTo do this, we will alter the  \"makePersonObject\"  constructor to add the method to each objects it creates.  Let's name that method \"pay\".  \nThis method takes no arguments, and when called, it returns the total\npay earned by the person the object represents.  \nThis is computed by multiplying the person's pay rate by the person's hours worked.\nTo get credit for this overview:Let's take the \"makePersonObject\" code we had before and alter to put a very simple function into each object it makes.\nThis function will report back the name of the person when it is called. Here is the new constructor code (and a myMain to exercise the constructor):\n\"use strict\";\n\nfunction myMain () {\n  var emp = makePersonObject();  // this makes a person object \"emp\"\n  alert( emp.getName() ); // this is a method call on the object \"emp\"\n}\n\nfunction makePersonObject ( ) {\n  var perObj = {\n    id: Number(prompt(\"person ID number?\")),\n    name: prompt(\"person name?\"),\n    hours: Number(prompt(\"hours worked?\")),\n    payrate: Number(prompt(\"pay rate?\")),\n\n    // this is how we put a function into an object\n    // we make an anonymous function and bind it to a field name\n    getName: function ( ) { return this.name; } \n\n  };\n  return perObj;\n}\n\nmyMain();\nHere we create a person object in myMain, and then call the \"getName\" in that object. We then print out the string returned by that method.  In this way, the\nobject is \"telling us\" the name it contains.\nPut this code in your editor window, test it locally, and then submit it for score.\nSoftware Engineering lesson.Not looking inside an object at its data fields... letting the object itself worry about manipulating the data fields... getting information from an\nobject by calling methods and letting the object send us data... this is called \"information hiding\".  We think of an object as being a\n\"black box\" and we don't see it internals.  We do see it's public interface... it's methods and how to call them (the arguments the methods need when called).\nIf we want information, we ask the object to supply it rather that reaching inside and taking it.  In this way, complicated manipulations can be written once\nand put into the object as methods.  This is an example of the DRY principle at work. We do not repeat complicated manipulations of object data fields all\nover our code; rather we put them into the objects, as methods, each defined once.  Then we call the functions when we need the information,\nSome programming disciplines go as far as making data field invisible.. unable to be read outside the object.  Then to get something simple \n(like the value of the name field in our person object) we would put a method like \"getName()\" in the person object.  Maybe we put in a \"setName(s)\" method \nas well, in case we need to change the name stored in the object.  We would not be allowed to do something direct like persObj.name = \"Smith\" from outside the\nobject.  Information hiding helps keep the data in the object consistent, since it cannot be changed by any code that it not a methods in the object.\nThese simple methods that produce, or update, the values of the data fields are called \"getters\" and \"setters\".  The \"getName()\" methods we wrote in this overview code\nis an example of a \"getter\" method.\n"

This means the code works for exactly 3 persons, and if the user\nhas more (or fewer) to work with, then the code must be re-written (a little bit) to alter the number (and names) of the variables used to store\nthe person objects.\nIn this new program we will make a loop and keep constructing objects until the user says we\nare done.

Repeat the two different alerts and see what happens.\nThe reason we now see a difference is because the payFunc method computes using whatever happens to be stored in the rate and hours fields at the time the\nmethod is called (the \"this\" keyword says to use the fields dynamically).  \nSo if we change the values stored in those fields during computation, the result returned by the methods call will change accordingly.\nHowever, the payData field is static; it's value is created and stored when the object is made, using values from local variables (parameters) in the constructor memory map.\nThose values are fixed at construction time and do not change as computation progresses.\n"

An object is a collection of data, and functions (methods) that\noperate on the data in the object.  One way to think of an object, then, is as a little data base... or a fat \"variable\".\nIn this program we will use two objects to collect and keep track of some information about input a user gives as the\nprogram runs.\nStructural Requirements: For this program, define a \"myMain\" function and call it to make the whole thing begin execution (as always is our style).\nYou will also write a function called \"makeNewAvgObj\" as described. \nYou will also write a function called \"getGoodNum\" as described. \nFeel free to write and use as many functions as you wish, but at least write these three.\nWrite a program to do these things:\nmyMain : Create two \"averager\" objects (call function makeNewAvgObj to create an averager object). \nWe will use one of them to average positive user input numbers, and use the other one to average negative input numbers.\nAn averager object will be given numbers (by calling its \"add\" method) and will keep track of the running sum of all the numbers added to it.\nIt will also keep a count of how many numbers have been given to it, so that it can report the average of those numbers at any given time.\nIn a loop, get a good input number from the user; you will make one of the two averager objects deal with each input number (base of whether the number is positive or negative);\nKeep looping until the user gives a \"0\" as input.  You will use the function \"getGoodInput\" to do all the necessary validating (see details following)\nAs noted, each time \"getGoodInput\" returns a valid input number, first see if it is a 0; if so stop the input loop and go to the output section.\nIf the input number is not 0, then check to see if it is positive or negative. \nIf positive, call the \"add\" method on your positive averager object; if negative, call the \"add\" method on the other averager object.\nWhen the input part is done (user gives a 0), call the \"avg\" method on the positive averager object and print the result it returns. Then call the \"avg\" method on the negative averager object and print the result it returns. This mean your program will have two separate alert statements.  Use the output format show below in the sample executions.\nMakeNewAvgObj : To assist you, write and use a function named \"makeNewAvgObj\" (with no parameters) that will make and return an Averager object. \nThis object will have a data field \"sum\"; a data field \"count\"; a function field \"add\"; and a function field \"avg\". \nThe \"sum\" field will hold the accumulated sum of all the numbers passed to the object (when its \"add\" method is called). \nThe \"count\" field will keep track of how many times the \"add\" method is called (in other words, it will count how many numbers got added into the sum). \nThe method \"add\" will take one parameter -- a number; it will add that number into the \"sum\" field, then increment the \"count\" field, and then it returns nothing. \nThe \"avg\" method takes no parameters; it will return the average of the numbers that have been sent to the object. It will divide the \"sum\" field by the \"count\" field and \nreturn the resulting number. \nBe careful to not divide by 0, which might happen if \"avg\" is called before any numbers have been added in. In this case, simply return a 0 as the average without \ndoing any division.\ngetGoodNum : To assist you, write and use a function named \"getGoodNum\". This function will interact with the user when a number is needed, \nand will implement the \"re=ask the user\" strategy for validating input. The user will be asked for a number and if the input is invalid \n(any number is valid) it will alert \"error\" and ask again for a number. When a valid number is received, that number is returned by the function.\nSample executionsUser input: 1, -7, 3, -11, 5, -9, 0\nOutput:   3    User input: 2, 3, 4, 5, 7, 0  \nOutput:   4.2  \n          0    \nUser input: 0\nOutput:   0 \n          0    \nUser input: hello, 2, 3, -2, -3, 0\nOutput:   error\n          2.5\n          -2.5  \nUser input: -1, 3, stop, -2, 4, help, 0\nOutput:   error\n          error\n          3.5\n          -1.5\n \nUser input: hello, ten, help, -1, 0\nOutput:   error\n          error\n          error\n          0\n          -1        \nStyle notes.

I will then manually award the rest of the style points and the functionality points \nby examining and running your code. When you have tested the code and are ready for it to be scored, \nsubmit it and then click \"share\" on it so I will see that you wish me to take a look.  I will only grade it once\nmanually, so be sure you have tested it well before sharing it.\nThe programWrite a program that will create an array and put into it some integers randomly generated between 10 and 30 (including possibly each end point), making sure that all\nthe numbers in the array are unique (no duplicates). \nThe size of the array will be given by the user as the first thing; you will validate (see below).\nOnce the array is properly filled, print the entire array with one alert statement.\nThis is a more complicated program than most previous bricks. Here are some specifics:\nFirst, you will be validating the user input\nNext, you must make sure each new integer you store in the array is unique -- that is, make sure it is not already in the array before you store it.  \nAlso, you must write 5 functions here... myMain, getGoodInput(), genRandomInt(low,hi), alreadyIn ( n, arr ), and genUniqueIntArray ( n, hi, lo )\nFunction detailsgetGoodInput()  For this function you will use the re-ask-the-user strategy; call this function and have all user interaction (prompts) inside it.\nAsk the user for an integer that is between 1 and 20 (inclusive), and make sure you get one; if the user gives anything else (meaning a string, a non-integer, \na value smaller than 1 or larger than 20) print \"error\" and re-ask for input.\ngenRandomInt ( low, hi )  For this function, call Math.random inside it  and then adjust tvalue so that the \ninteger returned lies within the range lo to hi... inclusive of each.  You did this in an earlier brick, so go back and find that code.  \nTest it carefully to make sure it will be able to generate both lo and hi, and nothing outside that range.\nalreadyIn ( n, arr ) For this function you check to see if parameter value \"n\" is in the array \"arr\". If it is, return a true; if it is not, return a false;\nYou will call this function after you generate a new random integer to see if the number should be added to your array or not.\ngenUniqueIntArray ( n, lo, hi )  For this function you will create and return an array with unique random integers in it, each integer \nbetween lo and hi (inclusive).\nThis function will call genRandomInt and will also call alreadyIn to decide if the new random integer is already in the array being built. \n If it is there, simple call genRandomInt again.. and again if necessary... until the number you get back is not in the array. \nAt that point you add it to the array and keep going until the array is full.  Once the array if filled, return the array.\n myMain  The myMain code is fairly simple.  First, call getGoodInput to ifind out from the user how many integers to generate into the array.\nThen call genUniqueIntArray and pass it the user's array size number, as well as the range (30 hi, 10 low).  Capture the array that is returned and save\nit in a variable. Then print out the entire array in one alert statement.\n"

Details follow. \nWe will do the same basic computation that we did back in \"Function power (a,b)\" in module \"Utility functions\", but this time we will use fully abstracted validation to get good user input.\nThis means we will implement the \"re-ask the user\" strategy and keep trying for good input until the user gets it right.  Here is the code we can use for function power:\nfunction power ( b, e ) {\n  var pow = 1;\n  for (var i=1; iWrite a \"myMain\" function that will ask the user for two numbers, a base and an exponent (ask for base first).  \nYou will need two validation functions: one will get a good integer input (like the previous problem), and the other will get good numeric\ninput (any real number is ok, including integers).  Let's call them \"getGood_NonNegInt_Input\" and \"getGood_Number_Input\".  You will use \n\"getGood_Number_Input\" to get the base, and use \"getGood_NonNegInt_Input\" to get the exponent.  \nOnce you have a good base and a good exponent from the user,\ncall function power on them and print out the number that is returned.\nUse the format shown below in sample execution.  It is more than just the number produced.  It has some explanatory text with the result of power.\nThe difference between the two validation functions is small,\nbut important.  We want the base to be any valid number (positive, negative, or 0).  We want the exponent to be a non-negative integer (raising to the 0 power is ok).\nBoth will re-ask the user when input is rejected.\nBoth functions will reject input that is non-numeric (text like \"goheels\");  when non-numeric input is given, print \"not num: try again\" and re-ask the user.\n\"getGood_Number_Input\" will accept and return any valid number the user types.\nFunction \"getGood_NonNegInt_Input\" will further reject any number that is not also a positive integer or 0.  \nIf a non-negative number is given, or a non-integer number, print \"need non-neg int: try again\" and reask the user.\nYou can base both these validation functions on \"getGoodInput\" from the previous VID problem, simply adjust the conditions that are checked in each and the error messages\nas appropriate.\nSo your program will have 2 fully abstracted input functions, a myMain function, and any supporting functions needed like isInt, isPos, etc.\nNote that 0 raised to the 0 power is undefined mathematically (look at the graph of x^y at the origin), but we are going to make our program produce 1 when we raise anything to the 0 power, (including raising 0 to the 0 power).  We also have 0 raised to any positive integer exponent is 0.\nSample Executionbase? goheels \nnot num: try again\nbase? -3\nexponent? 2\nbase -3 raised to power 2 is 9\nbase? 4.21 \nexponent? coding is cool\nnot num: try again\nexponent? -3\nneed non-neg int: try again\nexponent? 3\nbase 4.21 raised to power 3 is 74.618461\nbase? 5 \nexponent? -2\nneed non-neg int: try again\nexponent? 2.34\nneed non-neg int: try again\nexponent: 0\nbase 5 raised to power 0 is 1\nbase? 0 \nexponent? 4\nbase 0 raised to power 4 is 0\nbase? 0 \nexponent? 0\nbase 0 raised to power 0 is 1\n"
